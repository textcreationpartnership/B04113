            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>After that day fair <hi>Roſamond,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>the King did ſee no more:</l>
               <l>For when his Grace was paſt the Seas,</l>
               <l>and into <hi>France</hi> was gone,</l>
               <l>Queen <hi>Elinor</hi> with envious heart,</l>
               <l>to <hi>Woodſtock</hi> came anon.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And forth ſhe calls this truſty Knight,</l>
               <l>which kept this curious Bower,</l>
               <l>Who with his Clew of twined Thread,</l>
               <l>came from the famous Flower:</l>
               <l>And when that they had wounded him,</l>
               <l>The Queen his Thread did get,</l>
               <l>And went where Lady <hi>Roſamond</hi>
               </l>
               <l>was like an Angel ſet.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But when the Queen with ſtedfaſt eye,</l>
               <l>beheld her heavenly face,</l>
               <l>She was amazed in her mind</l>
               <l>at her exceeding Grace:</l>
               <l>Caſt off from thee theſe Robes (ſhe ſaid)</l>
               <l>that rich and coſtly be.</l>
               <l>And drink thou up this deadly Draught,</l>
               <l>which I have brought to thee.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But preſently upon her knees</l>
               <l>ſweet <hi>Roſamond</hi> did fall,</l>
               <l>And Pardon of the Queen ſhe crav'd</l>
               <l>for her offences all:</l>
               <l>Take pity on my youthful years,</l>
               <l>(fair <hi>Roſamond</hi> did cry)</l>
               <l>And let me not with Poiſon ſtrong</l>
               <l>enforced be to die.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I will renounce my ſinful Life,</l>
               <l>and in ſome Cloyſter 'bide</l>
               <l>Or elſe be baniſhed if you pleaſe,</l>
               <l>to range the World ſo wide,</l>
               <l>And for the Fault that I have done,</l>
               <l>though I was fore'd thereto,</l>
               <l>Preſerve my life and puniſh me,</l>
               <l>as you think good to do.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And with theſe words her lilly hands,</l>
               <l>ſhe wrung full often there,</l>
               <l>And down along her comely face,</l>
               <l>proceeded many a tear:</l>
               <l>But nothing could this furious Queen,</l>
               <l>there with appeaſed be,</l>
               <l>The Cup of deadly Poyſon ſtrong,</l>
               <l>as ſhe ſat on her knee,</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>She gave this comely Dame to drink,</l>
               <l>who took it in her hand,</l>
               <l>And from her bended knee aroſe,</l>
               <l>and on her feet did ſtand:</l>
               <l>And caſting up her eyes to Heaven,</l>
               <l>ſhe did for mercy call,</l>
               <l>And drinking up the Poyſon ſtrong,</l>
               <l>her Life ſhe loſt withal.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And when that Death through every limb,</l>
               <l>had done her greateſt ſpight,</l>
               <l>Her chiefeſt Foes did there confeſs,</l>
